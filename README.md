# 2D ambiguity_fn

Simulates the Ambiguity Function of a Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) Chirp pulse. The resultant surface of the function should be assessed to extract characteristic features of the function. Additionally, the Cramerâ€“Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) method is used to estimate the variance of a frequency of a signal that is embedded in noise.

# 2D ambiguity_fn

Simulates the Ambiguity Function of a simple square pulse and produces 3D surface for analyses.
